# unrealengine-5-mrs-3d

This project is an Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) module for generating 3D procedural content, designed for Mixed Reality Simulation (MRS) and advanced 3D workflows.

## Features
- Procedural generation of 3D environments and objects
- Custom Blueprints and C++ components for extensibility
- Loading screens, error handling widgets, and utility materials
- VR and standard input support

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository** into your UE5 project's Plugins or main directory.
2. **Open the project** with Unreal Engine 5 (recommended 5.x).
3. **Build the project** using the UE5 Editor or Visual Studio (ensure you have the required dependencies).
4. **Explore the Content/** folder for Blueprints, Widgets, and Materials.
5. **Modify or extend** the C++ code in `Source/` for custom logic.

## Folder Structure
- `Config/` – Project configuration files
- `Content/` – Assets: Blueprints, Materials, Widgets, Textures
- `Source/` – C++ source code and modules
- `ThirdParty/` – Third-party libraries and headers

## Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.x
- Windows 10/11 (recommended)
- Visual Studio 2019/2022 (for C++ builds)

## Usage
1. Launch the project in UE5 Editor.
2. Use provided Blueprints or C++ classes to generate and interact with procedural content.
3. Customize assets and logic as needed for your application.
